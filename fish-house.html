          <strong>PROCESS OF CREATING A VISUAL IDENTITY</strong><br /><br />
          For this project, I developed the visual identity for the restaurant:
          'Fish House', which serves sea food. The process began with creating
          two moodboards to capture the atmosphere of the brand. From there, I
          designed the logo, starting with sketches, and selected a suiting
          typeface. I also created a pattern and produced several mockups to
          visualize the brand. The goal was to create a restaurant with a cozy
          atmosphere and fresh sea food.

          <strong>MOODBOARD</strong><br />
          *<em>restaurant</em><br /><br />
          For this restaurant's brand identity I want to create a cozy
          atmosphere. I chose a combination of elements that give the feeling of
          both luxury and warmth. The color blue represents the ocean, giving a
          direct connection to the fresh seafood that will be served, while also
          creating a sense of calmness and elegance. Wooden furniture adds a
          natural, earthy feel, providing warmth and comfort to balance the
          atmosphere.

          <strong>MOODBOARD</strong><br />
          *<em>visual identity</em><br /><br />
          For the visual identity moodboard I focused on creating a balance
          between simplicity but elegance. The chosen images feature drawn fish
          and shells with a few textures, adding depth and character instead of
          just clean and straight lines. The color palette includes blue which
          symbolizes the ocean. I also incorporated some touches of orange to
          add warmth.

          <strong>LOGO CREATION PROCESS</strong><br /><br />
          To develop the logo for Fish House, I experimented with many different
          versions and I tried out various details and levels of complexity. I
          tried different fish shapes, playing with both vertical and horizontal
          orientations and adjusted the amount of detail in each design. I also
          explored different placements for the text to see how it would look
          together with the fish.

          <strong>RESTAURANT SIGN</strong><br /><br />
          This sign represents the visual identity I created for a fish house
          restaurant. It shows a beige background with a blue typeface and logo.
          The design is clean and modern, ensuring strong visibility and
          recognition. The contrast between the sign and the black brick wall
          makes it stand out and it creates an inviting presence for the
          restaurant.

        <p class="category-text">
          <strong>PATTERN DESIGN</strong><br /><br />
          For the restaurantâ€™s pattern, I chose to incorporate the fish logo as
          the central element, repeating it across the design. The vibrant
          orange fish stand out against the beige background of the pattern. The
          orange color creates warmth and draws attention without overwhelming
          the design.
