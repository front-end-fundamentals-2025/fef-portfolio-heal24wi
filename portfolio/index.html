    <h1>PORTFOLIO</h1>
    <h2>Hello, I am Alina!</h2>
    <p>
      I am Alina, a 21-year-old from Germany. <br /><br />
      I graduated from high school in 2023, and since then, I have been<br />
      travelling and gaining new experiences. After finishing school, I
      explored<br />
      Europe on my own, and then I did work-and-travel in Canada, which was
      an<br />
      amazing opportunity to discover a new country and connect with people
      from<br />
      all over the world. Since a long time already, I am dreaming about<br />
      studying in Sweden, which is why I am currently pursuing a bachelor’s<br />
      degree in <em>New Media Design</em> at Jönköping University.<br /><br />
      I have a passion for creativity and design since my childhood, and I am<br />
      excited to improve my skills in this field. I am very often inspired by<br />
      new ideas and I love to bring them to life, whether it is graphic
      design,<br />
      digital media, or any other creative project, I am always<br />
      excited to try out new things.<br />
