      <p>
        I am Alina, a 21-year-old from Germany. <br /><br />
        I graduated from high school in 2023, and since then, I have been<br />
        travelling and gaining new experiences. After finishing school, I
        explored<br />
        Europe on my own, and then I did work-and-travel in Canada, which was
        an<br />
        amazing opportunity to discover a new country and connect with people
        from<br />
        all over the world. Since a long time already, I am dreaming about<br />
        studying in Sweden, which is why I am currently pursuing a bachelor’s<br />
        degree in <strong>New Media Design</strong> at Jönköping University.<br /><br />
        I have a passion for <strong> creativity </strong>and design since my
        childhood, and I am<br />
        excited to improve my skills in this field. I am very often inspired
        by<br />
        new ideas and I love to bring them to life, whether it is graphic
        design,<br />
        digital media, or any other creative project, I am always<br />
        excited to try out new things.<br />
